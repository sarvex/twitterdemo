Twitter Demo
http://railstwitterdemo.herokuapp.com/

A Rails app where a user can mass follow and mass unfollow people on Twitter.

 * A user logs into his/her Twitter account using the Twitter OAuth API. For
   exercise, not relying on Twitter gem or any other Twitter-specific libraries.

 * The user should be able to logout from their Twitter account.

 * The app pulls back a paginated list of people the user is following, with 20
   results per page â€“ 'followees'

 * Next to each followee is a checkbox saying 'unfollow'. At the bottom there
   is a 'submit' button which performs the unfollow actions that the user has
   requested.

 * Additionally, at the top of the page there is a search box. Entering a
   search term into the box pulls back Twitter profiles whose messages or
   profile match the search term.

 * Next to each of these search results is a 'follow' checkbox, with a 'submit'
   button at the bottom.

 * Any state changes should be reflected in the hash part of the current page's
   URL.


App depends on the following environment variables to be set correctly:

 * TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
 * TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET


Questionable Design Decisions:

 * A user is able to _try_ to spoof another user, resulting in twitter
   thinking that our application is trying to do operations it does not
   have access to.
 
 * A user is able to access any and all of twitter's API in our app's name,
   but only with their access token.
 
 * No dependency on database - everything is stored client side.
